# hang-man-game-in-python

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game. Here's how it works:

Choose a word: A word is selected at random from a predetermined list or category.
Display blanks: The word is displayed as a series of blanks, one for each letter in the word.
Guess a letter: The player guesses a letter.
Check for matches: If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the blanks. If not, a part of a hangman figure is drawn.
Repeat: The player continues guessing letters until they either:
Guess the word: If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word before the hangman is complete, they win.
Lose: If the hangman figure is completed before the player guesses the word, they lose.
The goal of the game is to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn.
